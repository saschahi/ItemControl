Welcome to my 2nd Mod! If you like this mod you're sure to like my other Mod "NPC Control"!

At the moment this mod has 2 Feature:
- Ban Items of your choosing (They're getting deleted and a optional Chat Message pops up)
- **New** Items can also just be banned from being used, but still allow their possesion/crafting of those items.

Hope this will help some Server Owners with their "Item Frame" problems and similar issues.

Also compatible with Items from other mods!

How to use:
1. Ingame go to settings
2. Click Mod Configuration
3. Click "Item Control: ItemConfig"
4. Add Items of your choosing to the list
5. Click Save after you put the banned items on the list.

And the best part?
It's compatible with HEROsMod! If it's detected to be installed on your Server, we add our own Permission to HEROsMods Permission System!
Now the People with permission can change what's banned and what's not.
